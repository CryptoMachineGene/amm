🧩 **Project Overview**  
A complete educational DEX stack demonstrating core decentralized finance principles.  
This Automated Market Maker (AMM) implements the Uniswap v1 constant-product model (`x × y = k`)  
with ERC-20 token pairs, liquidity provisioning, and on-chain price discovery.  

It includes a full-stack workflow using **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, and **Ethers.js** on the backend —  
paired with a **React + Redux** frontend for live swap and liquidity management.  
Designed for clarity, modularity, and hands-on blockchain developer training.

A minimalist **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** implementation modeled after Uniswap v1 — built end-to-end with **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, **Ethers.js**, and a **React + Redux** frontend.  
This repository demonstrates how decentralized liquidity pools, swaps, and LP share mechanics work under the hood, complete with a deployable test environment and modular scripts for both backend and UI layers.

### ⚙️ Features at a Glance
- **Constant product AMM (`x × y = k`)** — live pricing & liquidity mechanics  
- **ERC-20 pair (DAPP + USD)** — full swap, deposit, and withdrawal flows  
- **Hardhat testing + deploy scripts** — local & Sepolia-ready  
- **React + Redux frontend** — wallet connection, balance tracking, live charts  
- **Read-only analytics script (`poolInfo.ts`)** — fetches reserves and fees without a wallet

## 🚀 Improvements & Enhancements

This project was extended beyond the original tutorial to better reflect real-world AMM behavior and development practices:

- Removed stored invariant (`K`) and compute it dynamically during swaps to reduce redundant state
- Implemented a 0.3% swap fee (Uniswap-style), retained in the pool to benefit liquidity providers
- Refactored swap calculations for both token directions
- Updated test suite to handle precision, rounding, and dynamic outputs
- Introduced proper Git workflow (feature branching, pull requests, version tagging)

These changes improve correctness, reduce state redundancy, and align the AMM more closely with production-grade DeFi protocols.

## What You'll Learn

- How AMMs work using the constant product formula: `x * y = k`
- How to write and test smart contracts in Solidity
- How to deploy contracts using Hardhat
- How to connect a React frontend to smart contracts using Ethers.js
- How to manage blockchain state using Redux

---

### Smart Contracts
- ERC-20 token pair (DAPP + USD)
- Liquidity provision and LP share management
- Token swaps with price adjustment
- Share-based withdrawals
- Slippage protection

### React Frontend
- Connect wallet (MetaMask)
- Switch between networks (Sepolia or Localhost)
- Swap, Deposit, Withdraw, and Charts tabs
- Live account + balance tracking
- Identicon display with react-blockies

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amm-tutorial.git
cd amm-tutorial
```
### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

### 3.  Run Unit Tests
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### 4. Start Local Blockchain
```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### 5. Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 6. Seed the AMM Pool
This populates the pool and simulates some swaps.
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/seed.js --network localhost
```
Investor accounts will receive DAPP and USD tokens and perform swaps automatically.

### 7. Launch the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Redux State Management
- provider
  - connection, chainId, account
- tokens
  - contracts, symbols, balances
- amm
  - contract, shares, swaps (optional)

All state is synced through store/interactions.js.

## Smart Contract ABIs
Contracts are loaded dynamically using config.json per chain:
```json
{
  "31337": {
    "dapp": { "address": "0x..." },
    "usd":  { "address": "0x..." },
    "amm":  { "address": "0x..." }
  },
  "11155111": {
    "dapp": { "address": "0x..." },
    "usd":  { "address": "0x..." },
    "amm":  { "address": "0x..." }
  }
}
```

## AMM Smart Contract
The core logic for token swaps and LP share accounting.

### Key Functions
